# NOSjournaal : Bij opkomst van 30% is er een marge van 3% ? Dus 27 of 33 ? # WTF # Referendum;fear
# referendum # Netherlands Turn out elections still uncertain. Turn out is lower than last EU referendum. It will be a narrow outcome. # rf16;fear
Ach, begrijp het wel van # Rutte die pillen. Het is tenslotte een spannende dag vandaag # referendum # Oekraïne # MDMA http://bit.ly/25Ls3VI;anger

Zolang niet 100% duidelijk is wie verantwoordelijk is voor mh17 had dit # referendum nooit gehouden mogen worden m.i.;fear
Die 30%-drempel zou wel eens gehaald kunnen worden. Ik ga dus maar eens stemmen # referendum;anger
