So we  VoteLeave there will be enough money to build  nhs hospital every week or more doctor's but they won't.  twats  VoteStay;joy
Was unfortunate enough to see that  VoteLeave broadcast on BBC1 just now. Horriblly misleading, scaremongering shite.;joy
Disgusted at  voteleave nhs ad & the inaccuracies. £350m sent to EU each week but how much back in subsidies for roads, uni's, farms etc.;joy
Breaking Satire:  VoteLeave Where there's an elderly lady who has time for a cheerful cuppa before clogging up A&E  ClearlyNotAnEmergency;joy
Anybody believing the  VoteLeave broadcast must be expecting NHS funding to go up £18billion p.a. Under a Tory govt. Good luck with that.;joy
It's laughable that some people think by  VoteLeave will stop immigration. Absolutely hilarious.;joy
Seriously selective, simplistic, misleading shit from  voteleave broadcast.;joy
Hahaha great comedy from the  VoteLeave muppets. Dad’s Army graphics of how SCARY the EU is. £350m sent to Brussels every week WASTED!;joy
Shamefully Orwellian  voteleave TV broadcast;joy
Just seen the  VoteLeave broadcast and all Ive learnt is that £350mil is paid into EU every week and not the NHS. Seemed very scaremongering;joy
These  VoteLeave adverts using the NHS is hilarious and sad. The NHS that this government is systematically killing, is being blamed on EU;joy
£350million a week  VoteLeave;joy
Watching Paxman in Brussels DanHannanMEP just gave a few very good reason to take back independence  VoteLeave  EUref  brexit;joy
Dear  VoteLeave , I don't want to spend another £350million a week on the  NHS. Please find another angle.  PS your advert was shite.;joy
Learning from the  VoteLeave advert that smiling will be ILLEGAL if we stay in  EU;joy
"Interesting watching the  VoteLeave broadcast that shows NHS inside & outside EU"" What i actually see is ""before & after Tory governments""""";joy
I'm all for  voteleave but that  NHS party broadcast is BAAAD!;joy
If you  VoteLeave, you'll be happy to be in hospital and nurses and doctors will dress smarter.;joy
This  VoteLeave Party Political Broadcast is crap! It's repeated itself! Not a good advert!;joy
Unless this  VoteLeave broadcast is a committment that the mythical £350M a week will be spent on the NHS, it's a foul lie.;joy
Utterly ludicrous  VoteLeave referendum broadcast on BBC1;joy
This  VoteLeave advert on BBC 1 is absolutely hilarious... Do they think we are stupid?  VoteRemain;joy
